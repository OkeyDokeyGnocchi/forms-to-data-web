# Welcome to Forms-to-Data Web!

<h4>What is it for?</h4>
    Forms to Data allows users to upload the results from a survey (Google Forms,
    Microsoft Forms, etc.) as an .xlsx file to be converted into a database that
    will then be queried by a user-supplied query list in .csv form and will
    return a csv with the results for the user.
    
<h4>Why does it exist?</h4>
    <span>
      Forms to Data was created following a costly "campus climate" survey.  It became
      clear that many organizations cannot afford to hire someone to complete the work of turning
      survey results into data that they can use to determine direction and policy.  This data,
      however, can be very useful in helping to answer any number of important questions.
      By using a survey tool such as Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, etc. it is possible for organizations
      to collect results from surveys, and Forms to Data then allows them to take the resulting
      .xlsx file and run SQL queries against it without having to invest in databases
      and server hardware on their own end.

<h4>How can I use it?</h4>
    <span>
      There is a local command-line program available for Mac and PC which allows
      for more granular control over the resulting database files and allows for
      running queries against a database later, or a simple version that can be
      run online from this website.
